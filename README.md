# System-Analysis-and-Design
Work done for System Analysis and Design class 


The DriverPass project was a request for a complete system. The system was designed to help people learn how to drive with tests. These test were either online or in person practice road tests. The system was meant to make appointments and take online tests. 

I believe I did the diagrams well. They were interesting to do. 

If there was one area I’d like to redo it would be the business requirements document. I would like to understand better what and how things are suppose to go into it. I also could have done the functional requirements better.

I interpreted the user’s needs by reading the interview and the user stories. It is important to consider the user’s needs because they are the ones who will be using the system. 

I approached designing the software by reading all of the documents and readings that was required and used the internet for extra help.
